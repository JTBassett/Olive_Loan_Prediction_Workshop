# Olive_Loan_Prediction_Workshop
This workshop was created and hosted by J.T. Bassett for the entire Omega (support) department, with a focus on the Labs and Analysis teams. It was meant to be a quick, run-through of the model-building process, providing enough to get people started.

The code takes you through the entire process of building a basic predictive model including:
- Reading in the data
- Exploring
- Preprocessing
- Building the model
- Testing different hyperparameters

Users are encouraged to explore other applications of these techniques.
